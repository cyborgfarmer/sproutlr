    <h2>ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MODELS</h2>
    <!--(Primary Content Heading)-->
      
    <p>We believe everyone deserves access to healthy and affordable food. That’s why we want 2016 to be our year of experimenting with alternative payment models, such as Pay What You Can (PWYC). Rather than being forced to make less-appealing or less-healthy food choices, our PWYC model allows low-income families and individuals to purchase quality produce at prices that fit their grocery budgets. PWYC also allows those with higher incomes to pay prices similar to standard market value. If they wish to Pay It Forward, and help support our model, their payments can even exceed market value.</p>
    <p>To lower the cost of produce and operate our PWYC model, we’ve established a fund using a percentage of profits from high-value crops like Red Clover and Tulsi Basil and from our members’ value-added products such as herbal tinctures, bee pollen, and more.</p>
    <p>We currently offer PWYC produce on Saturdays at the Dogtown Farmers Market in Argenta and Sundays at the Bernice Garden Farmers Market in downtown Little Rock. Next year, we hope to expand our market presence across the city--through farmers markets and mobile food stands--and increase our produce offerings.</p>

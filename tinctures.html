    <h2>LEARN MORE ABOUT OUR TINCTURES</h2>
    <!--(Primary Content Heading)-->
      
    <p>We’re as interested in growing herbs as we are in growing fruits and vegetables. And we’re big believers in the potential for herbalism to impact our health in new and exciting ways. That’s why, with the help of a certified holistic nutritionist, we’ve developed a line of tinctures, using some of our favorite herbs, crafted right here in Little Rock.</p>
    <p>Tinctures are herbal formulas infused in alcohol. Ours include some amazing plants, like Passionflower, Yellow Dock, and Tulsi Basil. This process was originally a simple method for preserving foods. In pre-industrialized pharmacies, however, they quickly became standard practice.</p>
    <p>Herbalism is an underrated factor in the health of much of our modern society. Many of the natural world’s most nutritious plants are largely unrecognizable, unheard of, and unconsumed. Almost none of these nutrient-dense plants are grown in Central Arkansas. In fact, almost all of them are imported from other continents. Few originate from within the borders of the United States, let alone Arkansas. <b>This is a huge opportunity.</b></p>
    <p>By growing high-value medicinal crops suitable to our region and processing them into value-added products--like herbal tinctures--Sprout Urban Farms Co. (SUFCo) can infuse significant revenues into the local economy. We can also enrich diets, spread the gospel of herbalism, and use a percentage of our profits to build more urban farms and lower the cost of produce.</p>
